        <h1>Key Concepts in Web Browsing</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Web Browser</h2>
        <p>A web browser is an application that serves as the main interface between the user and the World Wide Web. It is a crucial and complex piece of client software responsible for interpreting, presenting, and requesting content. Without the browser to create the request and interpret the response, the web that we know today would cease to exist.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Client/Server Architecture</h2>
        <p>This is a fundamental distributed structure that divides workloads between providers (servers) and requesters (clients). The browser acts as the client, requesting content and services from the server. The server, in turn, hosts the files and applications. The communication messages exchanged between these two software components are called requests and responses.</p>
        
        <h2>3. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
        <p>HTML is the foundational language used to describe the structure of web pages. The browser reads HTML tags, such as headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) and tables (<code>&lt;table&gt;</code>), and renders the content to create something a user can read. A web page is fundamentally a text file marked up with HTML.</p>
        
        <h2>4. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
        <p>CSS is another language used in conjunction with HTML. Its role is to define the style and appearance of web pages, controlling visual elements like font, color, layout, margins, and borders. By separating style from content, CSS ensures consistency and flexibility across the entire website.</p>
        
        <h2>5. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</h2>
        <p>HTTP is the primary communication language within the web architecture. The browser uses HTTP to send requests to a web server and then uses it to receive responses back, which contain the web page content. It dictates how messages are formatted and transmitted.</p>

        <h2>6. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h2>
        <p>The URL is the unique address used to locate a specific resource on a web server. The browser uses the URL to know exactly which file and server to request. The URL’s components include the protocol (like HTTP) and the server's address (IP or domain) and the file path to the resource.</p>

        <h2>7. Rendering Engine</h2>
        <p>The rendering engine is one of the most critical and complex parts of the browser. It handles the scripts and markups by processing HTML and CSS to display the visual content. Examples of major rendering engines include Gecko (used in Firefox), Trident (used in older IE/Edge), and WebKit/Blink (used in Chrome and Safari).</p>
