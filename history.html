        <h1>Browser History and Evolution</h1>
        
        <h2>The First Steps and Mosaic</h2>
        <p><p>The first browser, created by Sir TIm Berners-Lee in 1989 was called the WorldWideWeb and it was both a browser and editor. It allowed users to create and view web pages. It was followed by browsers like Lynx which was a text based browser that was very popular for its simplicity and speed.</p></p>

        <h2>The Browser Wars</h2>
        <p>The success of Mosaic ended up leading into a “browser war” in the 1990s. The developers of Mosaic created a browser called Netscape Navigator and in response, Microsoft released the Internet Explorer in 1995. Internet Explorer had a massive advantage as it was bundled for free with the Windows operating system and by the late 1990s it was much more popular than Netscape. This era capitalized on the rapid development leading each company to outdo each other and it continued to make the web experience better for users. . The second browser war began in the mid 2000s with competitors like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.</p>
